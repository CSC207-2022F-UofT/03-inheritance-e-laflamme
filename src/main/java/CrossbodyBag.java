/*
 * TODO: Create a public class named CrossbodyBag which is a subclass of Bag
 *       In addition to the attributes in Bag, the CrossbodyBag should have an
 *       attribute named "numberOfStraps".
 *
 *       The constructor for CrossbodyBag should take the following parameters
 *       in order:
 *           1. a String for the color
 *           2. an int for the capacity
 *           3. an int for the number of straps
 *
 *       CrossbodyBag should also have a getter method called getNumberOfStraps
 *       and it should implement the enhance method.
 *
 *       The enhance method should increase the capacity of the CrossbodyBag by
 *       2 (as opposed to the 1 that HandBag increases by).
 *
 *       The toString method should be overridden to return a string in the
 *       in the same form as Bag's toString but with the original "Bag" part
 *       of the string replaced by:
 *           Crossbody Bag with {numberOfStraps} straps
 *
 *       See the tests in test/CrossBodyBagTest.java for examples.
