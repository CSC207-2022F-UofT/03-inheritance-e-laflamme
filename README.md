## Instructions

There are tasks to be done across all of the files in `src/main/java`. We recommend doing
them in the order:

1. `Bag.java`
2. `HandBag.java`
3. `CrossbodyBag.java`
4. `BagMain.java`

There are instructions at the top of each file along with TODOs.

### Readings
For this exercise, you will want to read through **Chapter 3: Relationships between Classes**.

The earlier readings (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2) may also prove to be helpful. 

### IntelliJ Reminders
Make sure you set the folder `java` under `src/main` as Sources Root in order to
get hints from IntelliJ. Similarly, you can set the folder `java` under `src/test` as
Test Sources Root in order to run the tests we've provided.


### Automarker results
After you add, commit, **and** push your changes to GitHub, the test cases given to you will automatically run. This may take a few minutes.

To access the results, go to the "Actions" tab from your GitHub repository. You should see a list of workflows: click on the top-most (most recent) run. In this, you should see the points at the bottom (e.g. the number of test cases you passed) along with an **Autograding** job above it: if you click on **Autograding**, you can see the results. Expand the `Run education/autograding@v1` part to see a full log of the results.
